    Session type: {session_type}
    Duration: {duration} minutes
    Mood: {mood}
    Notes: {notes}

    Recent session history (last 5):

    Completed challenges:

    Image URL (if provided): {image_url}

    If an image URL is provided, acknowledge it in your feedback.
    Comment on what you can infer from the image about their practice
    (setup, materials, progress, effort visible). Be encouraging about
    them sharing visual evidence of their work.

    Based on this information:
    1. Make 2-3 specific observations about their practice (what they did, patterns you notice)
    2. Identify 1-2 signs of growth (even small ones - consistency, trying new things, longer sessions)
    3. Suggest 1-2 specific next things to try that build on what they just did
    4. Write a brief celebration message acknowledging their effort

    Be specific to {hobby_name} - reference techniques, materials, and concepts relevant
    to this hobby. If their mood was frustrated or discouraged, be extra supportive and
    normalize the struggle.
