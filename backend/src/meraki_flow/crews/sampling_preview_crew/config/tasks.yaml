    Based on the user's quiz answers, recommend which of the 3 sampling paths
    would be the best fit for them to try {hobby_name}:

    1. Watch First - Passive discovery through curated videos
    2. Micro-Try - Instant 5-minute activity with no materials
    3. Find Locally - In-person class or workshop

    Consider these quiz signals:
    - Social vs solo preference (q3, q8): Solo learners → Watch First or Micro-Try; Social → Find Locally
    - Energy level (q5): Low energy → Watch First; High energy → Micro-Try or Find Locally
    - Learning style (q11): Visual learners → Watch First; Hands-on → Micro-Try
    - Schedule/time (q9, q15): Busy/unpredictable → Watch First or Micro-Try; Flexible → Find Locally
    - Comfort with new situations (q7, q14): Anxious → Watch First; Adventurous → Find Locally
    - Need for instant gratification (q10): High → Micro-Try; Patient → Watch First

generate_micro_activity_task:
  description: >
    Create a micro activity for {hobby_name} that the user can do RIGHT NOW in
    under 5 minutes with absolutely zero materials or preparation. The activity should:
    - Use only their body, senses, or objects already in any room
    - Give a genuine taste of the hobby's core mindset or skill
    - Be achievable for someone who has never tried this hobby
    - Feel like a "taste" not a "lesson"

    Examples of good micro activities:
    - Pottery: "Close your eyes and slowly trace the contours of a mug, noticing curves and weight"
    - Drawing: "Without looking at the paper, draw the outline of your hand for 60 seconds"
    - Photography: "Frame 3 interesting compositions using your fingers as a viewfinder"
  expected_output: >
    Return a JSON object with the following structure:
    {
      "title": "Catchy 2-4 word activity title",
      "instruction": "Clear 2-3 sentence instruction in conversational tone",
      "duration": "2-5 minutes",
      "why_it_works": "1 sentence connecting this to the real hobby"
    }

curate_watch_videos_task:
  description: >
    Use the youtube_search tool to find 3 YouTube videos that give a beginner the
    best introduction to {hobby_name}. Search for terms like:
    - "{hobby_name} beginner tutorial"
    - "{hobby_name} for beginners"
    - "how to start {hobby_name}"
    - "{hobby_name} first time"

    The videos should:
    - Be beginner-friendly (no jargon, no assumed knowledge)
    - Show the hobby in action (not just talking heads)
    - Be 10-20 minutes each (not too short, not overwhelming)
    - Come from credible creators who are good at teaching
    - Together give a complete picture: what it looks like, what you need, and why people love it

    After finding videos with the tool, curate the best 3 and explain why each is
    good for beginners.
