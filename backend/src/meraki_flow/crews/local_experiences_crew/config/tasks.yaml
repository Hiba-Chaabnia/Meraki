find_local_experiences_task:
  description: >
    Find local experiences where the user can sample {hobby_name} in or around
    {location}. Use both the google_places_search tool and web_search tool to
    find a variety of options.

    IMPORTANT — call each tool only ONCE:
    1. Call google_places_search ONCE with hobby="{hobby_name}" and location="{location}".
       The tool internally searches for classes, workshops, studios, and lessons.
    2. Call web_search ONCE with a query like "{hobby_name} beginner workshop meetup {location}".
       The tool returns a diverse set of results from across the web.

    Do NOT call either tool multiple times with different queries — each tool
    already handles query variation internally.

    From the combined results, select the best options and focus on:
    - Single-session experiences only (no multi-week commitments)
    - Beginner-friendly environments where first-timers are welcome
    - Free community events, meetups, or trial classes
    - Studios or spaces that offer drop-in sessions

    For each result, assess:
    - Is it truly beginner-friendly?
    - Is it a single session or ongoing commitment?
    - What's the approximate cost?

    Also prepare general beginner tips for this hobby: what to expect, what to
    wear, what to bring, and how to not feel awkward as a first-timer.
