find_local_experiences_task:
  description: >
    Find local experiences where the user can sample {hobby_name} in or around
    {location}. Use both the google_places_search tool and web_search tool to
    find a variety of options.

    Search for:
    1. Use google_places_search for: "{hobby_name} class", "{hobby_name} studio",
       "{hobby_name} workshop" near {location}
    2. Use web_search for: "{hobby_name} meetup {location}", "{hobby_name} workshop {location}",
       "{hobby_name} beginner class {location}"

    Focus on:
    - Single-session experiences only (no multi-week commitments)
    - Beginner-friendly environments where first-timers are welcome
    - Free community events, meetups, or trial classes
    - Studios or spaces that offer drop-in sessions

    For each result, assess:
    - Is it truly beginner-friendly?
    - Is it a single session or ongoing commitment?
    - What's the approximate cost?

    Also prepare beginner tips for each type of venue: what to expect, what to
    wear, what to bring, and how to not feel awkward as a first-timer.
