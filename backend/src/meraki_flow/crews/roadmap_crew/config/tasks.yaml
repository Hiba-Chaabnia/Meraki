  description: >
    Design a personalized multi-phase learning roadmap for someone practicing {hobby_name}.

    User context:
    - Total practice sessions: {session_count}
    - Average session duration: {avg_duration} minutes
    - Days active: {days_active}
    - Previously completed challenges: {completed_challenges}
    - User goals (from quiz): {user_goals}

    Calibration rules:
    - Beginner (<5 sessions): Start from fundamentals, create 5-6 phases
    - Intermediate (5-20 sessions): Skip pure basics, focus on technique, 4-5 phases
    - Advanced (>20 sessions): Advanced concepts + personal style development, 4 phases

    Each phase should include:
    - A clear, motivating title
    - A description of what this phase covers and why it matters
    - 2-3 concrete goals the learner should achieve
    - 2-3 suggested activities or exercises
    - Estimated time commitment per week

    The roadmap should feel like a journey, not a syllabus. Phase titles should be
    inspiring (e.g., "Finding Your Voice" not "Module 3: Intermediate Techniques").
